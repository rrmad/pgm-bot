# Evie.Code's Discord.JS Bot Guide - Season 2

This repository contains the code for each episode of my bot guide on YouTube.

## How does this thing work? 

Each branch of this repository will contain the totality of the code for that episode. 

The #master branch contains the *current* code for the latest episode. Once a new episode is out, a new branch is created for the previous episode's code. 

To navigate between each episode's code, simply click on the *Branch: **Master*** at the top, then select an episode.

In this video we'll install our pre-requisites for running Discord.js, setup our first bot, join it to the server, and make it ping! On top of that, we learn how to write proper code using ESLint, and how to debug that code using VSCode's Debug mode. A long episode, but an awesome one!

### Episode 3: Configs, Pings, Prefixes and more!
